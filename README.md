The name of our project is called Cat Nanny Express. Our project is a virtual pet care game. Our game will feature two APIs. The first API will consist of random cat images. The second API will randomly generate names for the pets in the image. 
When users first access our website, they will be prompted to enter in their nanny name. Once theyve gained access they will select which animal they want to tend to. Theyve the option of a cat or dog. once selected they will have three ways to earn health points (hp). The three ways will consist of food, playtime, and grooming.
